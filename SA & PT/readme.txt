These two files contain our implementations of Simulated Annealing and Parallel Tempering, namely SA and PT.
The input always contains a matrix Jij that describes interaction between site i and site j.
There are also other arguments, such as random seed, or initial state as a vector.
The parameters of these two algorithms are from:
    SA: https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2104
    PT: https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1054
These codes are written by different people (or same person in different time) so the coding styles might look different.
